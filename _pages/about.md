Aakash Solanki is a [PhD candidate](https://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/aakash-solanki) in Anthropology and South Asian Studies at the University of Toronto. His scholarship follows a genealogical approach to states, statistics, and computing, tracing how data infrastructures shape governance and social life across South Asia.

His current projects examine the politics of information in colonial India alongside contemporary experiments with digital governance. This work builds on professional experience in government agencies across the United States and India, where he led data science initiatives in education, health, and workforce development.

Research interests include:

- Bureaucratic archives, enumeration, and classification
- Digital statecraft and the ethics of data-driven decision-making
- Collaborative, mixed-methods approaches for anthropological research

His research program is supported by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. He has published in *South Asia* and serves as a Contributing Editor for *Cultural Anthropology*. Beyond the university, he convenes an interdisciplinary [Development Seminar Series](http://aakashsolanki.net/utdevsem.html) at the University of Toronto that links scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.
