Aakash Solanki is a [PhD candidate](https://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/aakash-solanki) in Anthropology and South Asian Studies at the University of Toronto. He studies how bureaucratic infrastructures and classificatory regimes travel across colonial and postcolonial contexts, with a particular focus on South Asian data governance.

His dissertation, <em>The State's Ledgers</em>, follows the materials and methods that stitch together archival ledgers, punch-card systems, and contemporary databases in Indian bureaucracies. The project draws on multi-sited ethnography, collaborative digital humanities work, and extended archival research to trace how categories of welfare, labor, and citizenship are produced and contested.

Before graduate school, Aakash led analytics and service-design initiatives for government partners in India and the United States. Those collaborations inform his current interest in how quantitative systems intersect with everyday administrative practices and the ethics of digital experimentation in public agencies.

Research areas include:

- Colonial and postcolonial histories of statistics and statecraft
- Design, deployment, and maintenance of data infrastructures
- Mixed-method and collaborative approaches to studying governance technologies

His fieldwork and writing are supported by the International Development Research Centre and the Wenner-Gren Foundation. He has published in *South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies*, contributed to *Cultural Anthropology* Fieldsights, and co-led the University of Toronto's Development Seminar Series linking scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.
