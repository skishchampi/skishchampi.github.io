[Management of Performance and Performance of Management: Getting to Work on Time in the Indian Bureaucracy](https://doi.org/10.1080/00856401.2019.1603262), South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, 42:3, 588-605

> This paper departs from the analytic lens of citizen versus the state and brings to attention intra-bureaucratic interactions in the wake of Aadhaar by focusing on the ongoing implementation of an Aadhaar Enabled Biometric Attendance System (AEBAS). Based on ethnographic research in a North Indian state, I show how AEBAS’ goals of performance evaluation and management were partially, and unintentionally, circumvented by staff members, in part owing to the socio-technical design of the system. I argue that an unintended consequence of projects using digital media technologies to quantify and manage performance is their tendency to produce a performance of management, and that scholars and activists must pay attention to such disjunctures inherent in projects of command and control.

> A piece I contributed to the [Academic Precarity in American Anthropology: A Forum](https://culanth.org/fieldsights/series/academic-precarity-in-american-anthropology-a-forum) by [Cultural Anthropology](https://culanth.org) where I wonder about the dissonance between anthropology's general suspicion of numbers and a sudden push for statistics in addressing the problem of precarity in american anthropology.
