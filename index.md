## About

* * *

Aakash Solanki is a [PhD candidate](https://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/aakash-solanki) in Anthropology and South Asian Studies at the University of Toronto. He studies how bureaucratic infrastructures and classificatory regimes travel across colonial and postcolonial contexts, with a particular focus on South Asian data governance.

His dissertation, *The State's Ledgers*, follows the materials and methods that stitch together archival ledgers, punch-card systems, and contemporary databases in Indian bureaucracies. The project draws on multi-sited ethnography, collaborative digital humanities work, and extended archival research to trace how categories of welfare, labor, and citizenship are produced and contested.

Before graduate school, Aakash led analytics and service-design initiatives for government partners in India and the United States. His research is funded by the International Development Research Center (IDRC) and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. He is a Contributing Editor to the journal *Cultural Anthropology* and has previously published in *South Asia*. He runs an interdisciplinary [seminar series on Development](http://aakashsolanki.net/utdevsem.html) at the University of Toronto.

["Untidy Data: Spreadsheet Practices in the Indian Bureaucracy."](https://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/lives-of-data-essays-on-computational-cultures-from-india/) In *Lives of Data: Essays on Computational Cultures from India*, edited by Sandeep Mertia. Theory on Demand 39. Amsterdam: Institute of Network Cultures.

> A book chapter contributed to a multi-disciplinary volume on data cultures from India. The volume brings together practitioners and researchers working on data science projects in India, both contemporaneous and historical. The piece examines spreadsheet processing in an Indian bureaucracy through the lens of statistical data processing and media technologies, and how media technologies — old and new — intertwine to produce work practices in bureaucracies.

[Management of Performance and Performance of Management: Getting to Work on Time in the Indian Bureaucracy](https://doi.org/10.1080/00856401.2019.1603262), *South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies*, 42:3, 588–605. 2019.

> This paper departs from the analytic lens of citizen versus the state and brings to attention intra-bureaucratic interactions in the wake of Aadhaar by focusing on the ongoing implementation of an Aadhaar Enabled Biometric Attendance System (AEBAS). Based on ethnographic research in a North Indian state, it shows how AEBAS' goals of performance evaluation and management were partially, and unintentionally, circumvented by staff members, in part owing to the socio-technical design of the system. An unintended consequence of projects using digital media technologies to quantify and manage performance is their tendency to produce a performance of management.

> A case study contributed to the Ethnographic Praxis in Industry conference on how to assess and improve digital literacy and state capacity in government agencies in India using anthropological research on state, governance, and bureaucracy.

> A piece contributed to the [Academic Precarity in American Anthropology: A Forum](https://culanth.org/fieldsights/series/academic-precarity-in-american-anthropology-a-forum) by [*Cultural Anthropology*](https://culanth.org) on the dissonance between anthropology's general suspicion of numbers and a sudden push for statistics in addressing the problem of precarity in American anthropology.
