For the past few years, my dissertation work has been scattered across archival boxes, field notebooks, and half-finished memos about the granular ways information moves through the Indian state. I wanted a public space to gather those fragments, sketch arguments in progress, and connect them to ongoing collaborations with public agencies. Hence this blog.

In the coming months I plan to alternate between three kinds of posts:

1. **Archival finds.** Short reflections on materials that rarely make it into formal publications—from punch card maintenance manuals to ledger annotations about caste classifications.
2. **Field dispatches.** Notes on contemporary experiments with digital governance, especially when algorithms inherit assumptions from much older bureaucratic procedures.
3. **Teaching experiments.** Syllabi riffs, classroom activities, and resources developed with students who are learning to combine ethnography with data science.

If you would like to follow along, you can subscribe via RSS or drop me a line about specific questions you would like to see addressed here. I am especially keen to hear from public sector practitioners navigating data work under conditions of infrastructural scarcity. Consider this a drafting table for ideas that will eventually filter into publications, policy memos, and collaborative toolkits.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for the first set of fieldnotes soon.
