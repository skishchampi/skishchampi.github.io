A sample blog page that demonstrates how to reference Tweets and timelines without relying on live embeds.

# Tweet

An example of referencing a tweet with a static quotation:

> "If you like it then you shoulda put a gem on it." — [@rubygems](https://twitter.com/rubygems/status/518821243320287232)

# Timeline

An example of summarizing a timeline:

- [@jekyllrb](https://twitter.com/jekyllrb) — official updates about the static site generator.
- [@jekyllrbhelp](https://twitter.com/jekyllrbhelp) — community-maintained support tips.
- [#jekyllrb](https://twitter.com/hashtag/jekyllrb) — contributions from the wider community.

# Additional Details

For more details on the original embed plugin visit: [jekyll-twitter-plugin](https://github.com/rob-murray/jekyll-twitter-plugin). Static references such as the ones above avoid runtime calls to the Twitter API during builds.
